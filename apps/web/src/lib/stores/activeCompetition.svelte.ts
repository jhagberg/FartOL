// Authored for fartol. Not ported from upstream.
//
// Module-scoped runes store for the operator's "active competition" —
// the workspace context for every comp-scoped surface (Avläsning, Anmälda,
// Resultat, Export, Hyrbrickor, Registrering). Backend already persists
// this in the `config` table; the store mirrors it so the sidebar nav
// and the pill switcher don't have to re-fetch on every render.
//
// Why this exists: clicking "Tävlingar" used to route to `/` and unset
// the URL-derived activeCompId, which silently disabled the rest of the
// nav. The pill makes the active competition explicit and survives that
// navigation. Per UX skill rule `back-stack-integrity` ("never silently
// reset the navigation stack or unexpectedly jump to home") and
// `empty-nav-state` ("explain why an unavailable destination is hidden,
// don't just hide it").
//
// Cross-tab consideration: a single laptop with a single browser tab
// is the supported configuration, so we don't ship a BroadcastChannel
// sync — if the operator opens a second tab, the second tab will hydrate
// from the same server state on mount.
