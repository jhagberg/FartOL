# REQUIREMENTS

Scoped requirements with REQ-IDs. Each requirement maps to one or more
phases in `ROADMAP.md`. Scoping uses three buckets:

- **v1** — MVP scope; must work for Phase 1–2 (club training + small competition)
- **v2** — extended scope; must work for Phase 3–5 (kids' finish + radio controls + O-ringen)
- **out** — explicitly not in scope for this project

REQ-IDs are stable and never renumbered. If a requirement is dropped,
it is marked `[dropped]` but the ID stays.

## Hardware integration

**REQ-HW-001 (v1)** — Read SI8, SI9, SI10, SI11 cards via BSM7/BSM8-USB
on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Parse all punches into structured form.
✅ **Linux read-chain completed in Plan 00-03 + Plan 00-04** — SI9/SI10/
SIAC decoders + BSM7/8 handshake + SI8_DET dispatch + GET_SI8 page-4
read; verified at the station level against upstream fixtures. SI11 and
macOS/Windows deferred to Phase 1.

**REQ-HW-002 (v1)** — Read SI5 cards. Legacy support is non-negotiable;
clubs still own SI5s.
✅ **Completed in Plan 00-03 + Plan 00-04** — SiCard5 decoder + GET_SI5
single-frame read path verified end-to-end through SiMainStation against
upstream fixture (16-punch + full 36-punch).

**REQ-HW-003 (v1)** — Read SIAC cards (Air+). Treat beacon punches as
regular punches when received via SRR dongle or station readout.

**REQ-HW-004 (v1)** — CRC16-CCITT-0x8005 validation on every incoming
frame. Reject malformed frames with logged diagnostic.
✅ **Completed in Plan 00-02** — siProtocol.ts CRC16 + parse + parseAll
with typed FrameError callback; 10 frozen vectors locked.

**REQ-HW-005 (v2)** — Receive autosend (`0xD3`) punches from BSF8/9
control stations configured in punch mode.

**REQ-HW-006 (v2)** — SRR USB dongle support for live SIAC beacon punches.

**REQ-HW-007 (v2)** — SI-Master / TimeMaster clock sync across stations.

**REQ-HW-008 (v2)** — BS11-BS/BL/LA contactless beacon station support.

**REQ-HW-009 (v2)** — SI-GSM / LTE-Modem support for cellular punch upload.

## Event log and synchronization

**REQ-EVT-001 (v1)** — Every punch becomes an immutable event
`(node_id, local_seq, event_type, event_time_ms, recorded_at_ms, payload)`.

**REQ-EVT-002 (v1)** — Edge node persists events to local SQLite in
append-only fashion. No UPDATEs or DELETEs on the `events` table.

**REQ-EVT-003 (v1)** — All derived state (results, splits, placements,
DNF status, class standings) is computed by stateless reducers over
the event log. No mutable result tables.

**REQ-EVT-004 (v1)** — Reducers must be deterministic and idempotent;
re-running them over the same log produces identical projections.

**REQ-EVT-005 (v2)** — Edge nodes synchronize their event logs with
peers over LAN/WAN using a custom push protocol. Dedupe by primary key
`(node_id, local_seq)`. No central coordinator required.

**REQ-EVT-006 (v2)** — Edge node tolerates network partition: continues
to write events locally, syncs when connectivity returns. No data loss
under any partition scenario.

**REQ-EVT-007 (v2)** — Central tier (optional) aggregates events from
all edge nodes into Postgres. Drives ElectricSQL read-sync to public
viewers.

## Competition workflow

**REQ-EVT-CMP-001 (v1)** — Create a new competition: name, date,
classes, courses. Persistable to local SQLite.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-002 (v1)** — Import a Purple Pen XML course file.
Auto-create classes if not already present.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-003 (v1)** — Import IOF XML 3.0 EntryList for start
list registration. Match competitors to classes.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-004 (v1)** — Manual entry: register a competitor at
readout time who was not pre-entered (walk-up registration).

**REQ-EVT-CMP-005 (v1)** — Auto-assign a punched card to its
matching course when the start list has the SI number; fall back to
operator confirmation otherwise.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-006 (v1)** — Mark DNF / MP based on missing or
out-of-order punches against the expected course.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-007 (v1)** — Display live results page (HTML) on
localhost during the event.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-008 (v1)** — Export final results as IOF XML 3.0
ResultList. Validate against XSD before saving.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-009 (v2)** — Relay support (2-leg, 3-leg, Tiomila,
Jukola, 1-man relay). Per-leg start, mass start, restart.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-010 (v2)** — Score event (rogaining): variable points
per control, time penalty for overstaying.

**REQ-EVT-CMP-011 (v2)** — Patrol / pair / group registration where
multiple competitors share a card or run together.

## User interface

**REQ-UI-001 (v1)** — Web UI (PWA) accessible on Chrome desktop and
Chrome Android. Must work on tablet form factor.

**REQ-UI-002 (v1)** — Three-click new-competition flow matching the
MeOS UX bar: create event → attach SI reader → ready to read out.

**REQ-UI-003 (v1)** — Readout view shows live feed of cards read,
matched to course, results visible immediately. No page reload needed.

**REQ-UI-004 (v1)** — Print thermal paper receipt with splits via
ESC/POS. Star TSP143, Epson TM-T20, Brother PJ-7 supported via
`escpos-printer-db`.

**REQ-UI-005 (v1)** — QR-code receipt: show QR on readout screen,
competitor scans, sees their splits and provisional ranking on phone.

**REQ-UI-006 (v1)** — Swedish UI strings as primary. English as
secondary. Translation infrastructure (i18next) from day one.

**REQ-UI-007 (v1)** — Accessibility: usable in bright sunlight on
13" laptop. No 12 px gray-on-white. Large hit targets for stressed
operators.

**REQ-UI-008 (v1)** — Multi-operator simultaneous editing of start
list, classes, and registrations. Yjs CRDT for shared form fields.

## External integration

**REQ-EXT-MEOS-001 (v1)** — MeOS coexistence: serve MIP `<entry>`
polls so a parallel MeOS install receives FartOL walk-up
registrations; accept MOP `<MOPComplete>` / `<MOPDiff>` POSTs so
MeOS-side state can be reconciled into FartOL on bridge restart.
Closed LAN; no auth (revisit for sanctioned events in Phase 2.1).
See `.planning/research/meos-protocols.md` for wire formats and
`.planning/phases/02-4-klubbs-mvp/02-CONTEXT.md` for the 14 round-2
implementation decisions (D-MIP-1..4, D-MOP-1..4, D-LIM-1).
