// CR-001 regression: codex review (post-bench) flagged that ESM consumers
// could not construct `SerialTransport` from the built ESM bundle because
// the source used a bare `require('serialport')`. The fix lives in
// `src/transport/SerialTransport.ts` (createRequire(import.meta.url)).
//
// This test exercises the ACTUAL built `dist/index.mjs` so a future regression
// to bare-require or `Dynamic require of "serialport" is not supported` ends
// up red here. The dist isn't always present (tests run before build in some
// flows), so when it's missing this test is a no-op — the prebuild gate in
// `pnpm test` is the right place to enforce dist-presence, not this test.
//
// See packages/sportident/NOTICE.md for cumulative attribution.
